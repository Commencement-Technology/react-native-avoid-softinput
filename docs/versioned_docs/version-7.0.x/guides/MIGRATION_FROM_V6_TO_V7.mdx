## Migrate to [`react-native-edge-to-edge`](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-edge-to-edge) to provide best support for Android 15 "edge to edge" mode

Since v7, the library supports detection of `react-native-edge-to-edge`.
Follow the [installation page](./INSTALLATION.mdx) for the recommended setup for keyboard handling on Android.
Existing `AvoidSoftInput.setShouldMimicIOSBehavior` function is considered deprecated from v7 and will be removed in future major versions.

```diff
useEffect(() => {
-  AvoidSoftInput.setShouldMimicIOSBehavior(true); // <---- Tell Android that library will handle keyboard insets manually to match iOS behavior
  AvoidSoftInput.setEnabled(true); // <---- Enable module
}, []);
```
